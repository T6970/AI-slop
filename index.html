        <h1>Welcome to the Experimental AI Code Repository</h1>

        <p>
            This repository contains various source code files that were generated by artificial intelligence
            systems. The purpose of this repository is to explore the creative and technical outputs of AI
            without applying human judgment, optimization, or practical filtering.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>  
            The code you are about to see may not function correctly, efficiently, or at all.
            This is expected behavior.
        </div>

        <p>
            Below are directories containing different categories of AI-generated artifacts.
            Each directory may include code written in different languages, styles, or paradigms,
            depending on what the AI decided was appropriate at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, repositories like this help document
            what AI-generated output looks like in its raw and unrefined form. No attempt has been made
            to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.
