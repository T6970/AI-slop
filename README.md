## Experiment of AI-generated code

This repository is a collection of experimental code snippets, entirely generated by AI. Each file is an isolated exploration, without a unifying purpose or production-ready functionality. Think of it as a sandbox of AI-generated ideas scattered across multiple files.

## Disclaimer

* **Experimental Only:** This repository is purely experimental. None of the code here is intended for use in other repositories or production projects.
* **License:** The code is released under [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), placing it firmly in the public domain. It is not licensed under GPL or any restrictive license because this repository is not meant for conventional software use.
* **No Strategic Shift:** This repository is **not** a statement of intent to "integrate AI" or make any projects "AI-first." In fact, the goals of other repositories remain explicitly **AI-free**. This is a standalone experiment for exploration, curiosity, and learning.

## Structure

Files are loosely organized by theme or type, but there is no guarantee of coherence or completeness. Expect randomness, quirks, and untested behaviors.

## Contribution

Contributions are not required or expected. If you wish to experiment alongside, feel free to fork and play—but remember this is purely experimental and not production code.
